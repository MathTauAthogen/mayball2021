                            <br/>
                            <p>There is wheelchair access. There is basic seating, an accessible toilet, a gender neutral toilet, and a hearing loop. There isn't a BSL interpreter, general car parking, or blue badge parking. There isn't a designated quiet space, although the Chapel is designated as a chill-out area, with less noise and visual stimulation.</p>
                            <br/>
                            <p>Please note that the entrance to the Senior Parlour is only 0.7 metres wide, and may therefore present difficulties to attendees requiring a wheelchair. This is one of many rooms being used for the Ball, and the others are all accessible and step free.</p>
                            <br/>
